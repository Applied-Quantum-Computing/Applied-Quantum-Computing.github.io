Applied Quantum Computation is about lowering the barrier to entry into the quantum computing field. Our goal is to
pack this site with personalized tutorials on different quantum algorithms, so **you** can learn how to use them.
There is a wave of quantum computing research on algorithms and hardware that pushing into new frontiers. This website
is not for those pushing the peak of the wave; it's here for those left behind in it's wake with personal, understandable
tutorials and commentary on the latest in quantum computing.

New projects are posted monthly. So far, all projects are done in [qiskit](https://qiskit.org), but we hope to include [Quill](https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil)
, [Q#](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit), [PennyLane](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane),
 and more! Beginners and experts will find something interesting. Find a project, get your fingers typing, and learn!
